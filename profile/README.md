# About Us

Apache is a discord bot created for my computer science A-Level coursework. It is complete with a web dashboard designed to make your experience as smooth and user-friendly as possible. 

Apache is designed to be a completely customizable bot, with any and all the features that you would come to expect from a premium bot. It is still in development, however we are always open to suggestions and improvements. 

If you would like to make a suggestion for the bot, please open an issue [here](), and we will evaluate how we could implement your suggestion. 

If you would like to contribute to the bot, please send us an email at [contribute@apachebot.net](mailto:contribute@apachebot.net), and we will be in touch regarding your contribution to the project.
